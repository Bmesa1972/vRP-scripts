# vRP_OnlineJobs
  
Hi, I wanted to share with you my S9 menu for vRP!
**NOTE** - This Menu only works with the dunko pack!

In the code you should have 4 more links that are 4 more backgrounds for the phone and 1 with the default one (black bg).

You can shoose between pink, gold, blue, silver and black! (prints below): 
[pink](); 
[gold](); 
[blue](); 
[silver](); 
[black](http://prntscr.com/ll8wp0).

You can edit the design.css but dont re-upload the file with my changes without my permission :)

Unfortunately, I couldn't make the header fit well as I wanted, but it looks cool so!

If you don't want to come always to the repo. you will have all the links commented in the file!

If you find any problems or a fix to keep the border on top of the header pull request your edit or contact me through discord (**MM#3844**) and I'll make sure that you get the Credit for the edit!

# Installation-
1.Copy the design.css from the download

2.Paste it in `vrp/gui` replacing the default design.css.

And It should Work.

# Enjoy!
